# Resize Div on scroll

Just an idea for a landing page / hero image effect.

Image is placed using object-fit and it's parent container shrinks as you scroll.

## Marquee

Marquee is resized by re-drawing the SVG path.  Marquee font size is incremented down in order to fit entire text.

To change the font size, either change the amount text in the HTML or edit the font size in index.js
